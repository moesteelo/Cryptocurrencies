# Cryptocurrencies
Using Unsupervised Machine Learning to examine the outcome of Cryptocurrencies data be and how to analyze it. 

## Analysis Overview

**The purpose of this project is to use Unsupervised Machine Learning to analzye a cryptocurrencies database and create a report that includes traded cryptocurrencies classified by their Unsupervised Machine Learning groups and feaures. Thsi classification report can be used by an investment bank to propose a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio to its clients. 
We use the following methods for the analysis:**

- **Preprocessing the Data for PCA**
- **Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA**
- **Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-means**
- **Visualizing Cryptocurrencies Results**
