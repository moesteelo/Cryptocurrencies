# Cryptocurrencies
Using Unsupervised Machine Learning to examine the outcome of Cryptocurrencies data be and how to analyze it. 

## Analysis Overview

**The purpose of this project is to use Unsupervised Machine Learning to analzye a cryptocurrencies database and create a report that includes traded cryptocurrencies classified by their Unsupervised Machine Learning groups and feaures. Thsi classification report can be used by an investment bank to propose a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio to its clients. 
We use the following methods for the analysis:**

- **Preprocessing the Data for PCA**
- **Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA**
- **Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-means**
- **Visualizing Cryptocurrencies Results**



## **Resources**
***Data Source:******[Crypto Data](https://min-api.cryptocompare.com/data/all/coinlist)***

***Software: Python 3.8.8, Anconda Navigator 2.1. 1, Conda 4.11.0, Jupyter notebook 6.4.6***


## **Results**

**After preprocessing and filtering the cryptocurrency data there are a total 532 tradable cryptocurrencies.**

### **Clusterig Cryptocurrencies using K-means - "Elbow Curve"**

**Using Unsupervised Machine Learning there is no known output. To group the cryptocurrencies, I will be using clustering algorithms alao known as the K-Mwan and project the findings using  data visualizations.** 
**Using the K-Means method the results produced the Elbow-Curve, which iterates k-values from 1-10**

**The best k-value appears at the Elbow-Curve of 4 and as a result an output of 4 clusters can categorize the cryptocurrencies data.**
